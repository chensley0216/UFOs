# Analysis on Creating UFO Sightings Webpage

<b> Overview </b>

The client is interested in writing about UFO citings in her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. The purpose of this project is to display the data using JavaScript and HTML so that the client can search for specific citings through filters, as well as share the website with others to use. 

<b> Results </b>

In order to use the webpage efficiently, the client will need to determine what data to filter.  Using the filters provided on the webpage, the client can type in specific categories, such as a city, state, or time allotment.  Press the Enter key or click anywhere on the page to filer the data. The data is then filtered by that category.  To reset and show all data, the client can simply delete the text in the filter boxes.

<b> Summary </b>

While the content is easily managed through the filtering system, it would be more efficient if the system contained various forms of the text instead of the abbreviated versions.  If the client were to attempt to filter for “California” instead of “ca,” none of the California sightings would appear.

In order to make this a more efficient system, it would be best to incorporate multiple spelling options so that the client is able to filter regardless of abbreviation.  It would also be helpful to rename the term “shape” as something to do with the time affiliation, as the current name is confusing and may not be understood by someone besides the client.
